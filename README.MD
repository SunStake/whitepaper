# SunStake White Paper

## Introduction

Since the blockchain (aka. distributed ledger) technology was first [introduced](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), a community of crypto enthusiasts emerged and has been growing rapidly. Blockchains are so different and isolated from the rest of the world that almost everything, even something as simple as running a trivial application, needs to be re-invented. With Bitcoin being the first ever blockchain-native asset (i.e. cryptoasset), the community has witnessed numerous others being created in the process. As the ecosystem continues to mature, the diversity of cryptoassets is expected to grow further.

However, the inherent isolation from the "outside world" also means that only assets that were created on blockchains in the first place can be transferred, used, and exchanged on-chain, which has essentially blocked access to a wide variety of valuable traditional assets such as gold and oil. In addition, despite growing in types and valuation, most cryptoassets are found to be highly co-related with Bitcoin after all, making the exposure to different kinds of cryptoassets less meaningful than desired.

Bringing off-chain assets on-chain, or even just bringing cryptoassets _cross_-chain, is a rather complicated process that's not as intuitive as one might think, which has resulted in further isolation not just between blockchains and the non-blockchain world, but also between different blockchains. For example, one cannot trade Bitcoins on Ethereum, or vice versa.

While truely taking assets cross-chain remains an unsolved puzzle, with the current blockchain infrastructure built and maintained by the marvelous community, the SunStake project sets out to bridge the aforementioned gap by enabling synthetic assets to be created and exchanged on-chain, without replying on any centralized party.

## Existing Alternative

Gaining exposure to non-crypto assets as well as assets from another blockchain is nothing new. There have been a number of different solutions around the problem, with the most popular one being the use of hard peg with centralized bridges.

Such a solution relies on a centralized party to keep a reserve of the underlying asset, and to issue a blockchain token representing that particular asset. The most famous example of this is probably [Tether](http://tether.to/), the issuer of multiple widely used such hard-pegged tokens as Tether USD (USDT) and Tether Gold (XAUt).

The main issue of such approach is the need for trust and transparency, which are difficult to establish. For the Tether example above, there have been constant concerns and allegations from the crypto community that the popular USDT token issuer isn't keeping enough reserve in its treasury, or has been dishonestly using it for investment to boost earnings. The fear and uncertainty around the trust-worthiness of Tether has historically caused significant USDT value deviation from 1 US dollar multiple times.

**The need for trust with the hard-pegging solution defeats the very purpose of blockchains**. Even if a service provider has an established track record, there's still no guarantee that it will continue to be well behaved.
